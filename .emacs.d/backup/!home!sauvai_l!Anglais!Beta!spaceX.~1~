paceX was able to launch and land a rocket booster it
had already used, saving millions of dollars.

Buying used instead of new is a good way to save money on clothes,
electronics and, apparently, space travel.

SpaceX successfully launched and landed one of its Falcon 9 rockets
in the Atlantic Ocean. What's new is part of that rocket made a trip to
the International Space Station in 2016.

The rocket's first stage, known as the booster, was saved from the
2016 mission and reused. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said the landing
marks a big first in the history of space travel.

"This is going to be, ultimately, a huge revolution in space flight.
It's the difference between if you had airplanes where you threw away an
airplane after every flight versus you could reuse them multiple
times," Musk said after the landing.
