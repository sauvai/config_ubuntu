# Gitflow integration for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides integration and support for [gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
It is based on [this gitflow implementation](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)
and intends to be fully compatible with it.

# Getting Started

If you already have gitflow set up for your repository, just start execcuting
gitflow commands from the Command Palette!
