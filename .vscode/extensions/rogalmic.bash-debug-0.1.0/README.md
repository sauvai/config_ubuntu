# VS Code Bash Debug
A bash debugger GUI frontend based on awesome bashdb scripts.

**Install bashdb** before usage:
* [apt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool) package manager
```{r, engine='bash'}
sudo apt-get install bashdb
```
* [yum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowdog_Updater,_Modified) package manager
```{r, engine='bash'}
sudo yum install bashdb
```
* installation from sources (advanced):
```{r, engine='bash'}
tar -xvf bashdb-*.tar.gz
cd bashdb-*
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
* verification
```{r, engine='bash'}
bashdb --version
```

# Overview
This is a SIMPLE bashdb debugger frontend. Useful for learning bash shell usage and writing simple scripts.

Hopefully bash will land on 3 leading platforms making this extension very useful.

Sample usage animation:
1. Creating launch configuration with "wizzard"
2. Running debug session

Dependencies:
1. bashdb 4.3
2. cat, mkfifo, rm, pkill

## Limitations and known problems
* Watch variables should be specified with $ at the beginning (this expression is evaluated in bash - for example `${#PWD}` returns path length)
* Currently debugger stops at first command.
* Executing "set -e" causes debugging script to exit (bashdb limitation). Consider using "trap 'exit $?' ERR" instead.
* Newest Windows 10 insider build 15014 seems to be working with some hacks (https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/2#issuecomment-209118529, https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/1489);
