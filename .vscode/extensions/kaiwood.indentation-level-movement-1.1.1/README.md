# Indentation Level Movement

Lets your cursor jump with or without selection vertically at indentation levels.

Default shortcuts are alt+up / alt+down on macOS and ctrl+up / ctrl+down on Windows and Linux, holding the shift key adds the selection.

What is this good for, you ask? With this extension, you can quickly zip through your source code, jump from method to method or select whole blocks of text with one key press:
